# Assessment

**Steps: **

created a maven project

added my required dependencies in my pom.xml

tried to set up like regular framework style by adding driver, base class, pages, utilities, config. and reporting.. but,then i thought- it's just a comparison and we may not need any of those. 

so, I've added my 2 files into the directory (Sheet1_Veeva & Sheet2_Veeva). 

within my src/java/test- it has the actual script to compare the files. 


**Many thanks :) **
